      <h2>Career Reflection</h2>
      <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>y career journey in sports marketing and management has been an exciting and ever-evolving experience. From working in collegiate athletics to leading initiatives with minor league baseball teams, I’ve had the opportunity to shape how organizations connect with their fans. These roles have reinforced my belief in the importance of creative storytelling, consistency, and audience-focused strategy. Each stop along the way has strengthened my ability to engage diverse audiences and adapt to new challenges.</p>

      <p>I’ve always strived to combine technical skills with a deep passion for sports. Whether I’m building a digital campaign or analyzing ticketing data, I find purpose in creating experiences that resonate with people. Marketing, for me, is not just about promotion. It’s about building meaningful moments that strengthen loyalty and drive impact. I take pride in creating campaigns that are as strategic as they are imaginative.</p>

      <p>As I look to the future, I plan to continue growing into leadership roles within sports marketing. I’m especially motivated by the opportunity to guide teams, shape creative direction, and use data to make smart, forward-thinking decisions. I hope to push boundaries in how we engage fans both inside and outside the stadium, finding new ways to bring energy to the sports experience.</p>

      <p>Above all, I’ve learned that success is rarely individual. The best outcomes come from collaboration, shared vision, and the humility to keep learning. As I advance in my career, I want to help others do the same: to be the kind of mentor who opens doors and offers guidance. If my work can inspire others to pursue their passions in this field, then I’ll know I’ve made an impact that matters.</p>
