     Hello! My name is Ben Remelius and I am in my second year in the MBA program here at Mizzou. I am also the Assistant Athletic Director for Marketing at the University of Central Missouri. I have some previous web development training, but only using a WYSIWYG. This will be my first opportunity to work hands-on with HTML and CSS. In this course, I expect to hone these skills and become a capable web developer. By the end of the course, I hope to have the skills I need to better develop ucmathletics.com, the official site of my athletic department. Working in sports, I rarely have free time, and when I do, my professional engagements with sports are often replaced with personal and casual engagements with sports, including playing and watching sports. I also like to read (which is often also about sports) and spend time with my fiancee, Katie, and our cats.
